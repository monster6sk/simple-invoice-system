# Simple Invoice System

## Project Title
Simple Invoice System

## Project Description
A blockchain-based invoicing system built with Clarity, enabling sellers to issue invoices to buyers that can be paid using fungible tokens. Each invoice is stored on-chain, ensuring transparency, immutability, and easy verification of payment status.

## Future Scope

- Include due dates and automatic late-fee penalties.
- Integrate with NFT receipts for proof of payment.
- Allow batch invoice creation for multiple buyers.
